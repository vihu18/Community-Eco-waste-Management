I have used HTML 5, CSS 3, BOOTSTRAP 5 in this project.
as for backend I chose python Django and JavaScript as scripting language.

When you use it, you have to execute required commands like creating virtual machine, installing Django and also migrating.
Then using 'python manage.py runserver' to execute

In case, it asks for approval for 1st registartion of admin-> Login as Superuser and approve it, it's not required every time.
